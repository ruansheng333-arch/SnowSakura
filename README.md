# SnowSakura: Physical Layer Implementation Specs for 15EG
## Target: 31.5ns Deterministic Latency for HKEX-OMD-C

### Physical Layer Design Philosophy

* **Determinism over Abstraction**: In the realm of 31.5ns latency, standard software stacks are nothing but propagation noise.
* **Hardware Sovereignty**: We bypass OS kernels, PCIe overhead, and standard IP blocks. Logic is mapped directly to the **GTH Transceiver** and dedicated **LUT** resources via manual routing.
* **Timing is Law**: Every clock cycle at 322.26MHz counts. If your logic takes more than 10 cycles, you've already lost the trade.
